    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Datensparsamkeit is a German word that's difficult to translate
  properly into English. It's an attitude to how we capture and store
  data, saying that we should only handle data that we really
  need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/datensparsamkeit/sketch.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days there's a lot of hype around the idea of Big Data -
  and with it the notion that we should capture and store every bit of
  data we can get our hands on. We might not have an immediate use for
  the contacts our users store in their address books, but we'll ask
  for it anyway in case it comes in useful later. We'll record every
  click on our website and squirrel it away in case we want to trawl
  it later. We set up our smartphone app to ask for location information so
  if we come up with some way to use that data later, we can. After
  all, storage is cheap - so why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the "capture-it-all" approach is that it raises
  serious questions of privacy. Even if we trust ourselves to not
  abuse the data we collect, each data store represents a target for
  criminals or government surveillance agencies. This issue is
  particularly fraught in Germany which has seen successive regimes
  where governments have carried out extensive surveillance of their
  citizens in order to control them. Germany consequently has strong
  data privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datensparsamkeit &lt;a href="#footnote-pronunciation"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; is a concept from these privacy laws that is an
  opposite philosophy to "capture-all-the-things". A translation isn't
  straightforward (which is why I've retained the German word) but
  loosely you might translate it as something like "data austerity",
  "data minimization", "data parsimony", or "data frugality". It means
  that you should always ask yourself why you are capturing or storing
  data, and look to handle only the minimum amount of data you need
  for your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this is tracking users on your web site to
  determine how many unique visitors you have. If the same person
  accesses several pages within a few hours, you want to count that as
  one visit. If they visit several times a month, you still only want
  to count them as a single visitor. One way to do this is to log
  IP addresses, you count each IP address as a single person &lt;a href="#footnote-nat"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. But an IP address is very revealing, and could be
  used for much more than counting vistors. Datensparsamkeit suggests
  that you shouldn't store the IP address directly, perhaps instead
  you should hash it and only store the hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar example involving IP addresses is using them to infer
  demographic information such as region and country. You can get most
  of this information and practice datensparsamkeit by just logging the first
  three octets of the IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datensparsamkeit isn't just about bad people stealing data, it's
  also about your relationship with the primary company themselves.
  The default attitude at the moment is that any data you generate is
  not just freely usable by the capturer but furthermore becomes their
  valuable commercial property.  Privacy advocates,
  including me, think this assumption needs to be changed. Companies
  should only capture what they need and the burden of demonstrating
  need should fall on them. In addition, of course, they must be
  completely transparant about what they capture, what they store, and
  who they share their data with. Any breaches of data security must
  be immediately publicized (instead of covered up, which is the
  current default).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't share my views on personal control of our own
  data, the risks of security breaches mean that datensparsamkeit is a
  wise course of action. If you hold data that you don't need, and
  someone steals it and causes damage, shouldn't you be liable for
  that damage? Even if there's no legal liability the publicity will
  have serious consequences - and thus there is risk for anyone who
  doesn't practice datensparsamkeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="acknowledgements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/"&gt;Erik D&#xF6;rnenburg&lt;/a&gt;
    introduced me to Datensparsamkeit. The meme "&#x2026; all the things"
    seems to have been around forever (at least a decade) so I'm glad
    Korny Sietsma taught me that &lt;a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/06/this-is-why-ill-never-be-adult.html"&gt;it started in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/div&gt;

      I realize that with Network Address Translation, things are
      rather more involved than this, but I wanted a simple example.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After I finished &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html'&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;, I created a small web site at &lt;a href='http://refactoring.com'&gt;refactoring.com&lt;/a&gt; to act as an online summary of the refactorings in the book. It&amp;#8217;s mainstay is a &lt;a href='http://refactoring.com/catalog/'&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt; which provides a brief summary of each refactoring. I built it around 2000 and until today it still was very much a product of the late 90&amp;#8217;s. Over the last few weeks I&amp;#8217;ve changed its appearance, made a more dynamic catalog page with some interactive filters, redrawn the diagrams, and added some deep links to the relevant pages of &lt;a href='http://my.safaribooksonline.com/0-201-485672/ch06lev1sec1'&gt;Safari Books Online&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve also added links and refactorings from the &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html'&gt;ruby edition&lt;/a&gt; of the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

His advice is to use the agile planning notions of stories and epics - using stories within a service and epics to coordinate across services. When doing this it&amp;#8217;s important to track progress at the program level because you only deliver business value when all the services involved in an epic are done.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A strategy that&amp;#8217;s been useful in these situations is using REST-style web-services as an integration mechanism. Brandon is writing an article to discuss the lessons learned from this, which talks less about things like HATEOS and more on the role of environment management, versioning, and contract evolution. This first edition of the article talks about the importance of defining logical environments, and he&amp;#8217;ll be publishing more sections to the article over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bliki: HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst.html"/>
    <updated>2013-10-10T10:32:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I've written on this site about the
  problematic &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DiversityImbalance.html"&gt;DiversityImbalance&lt;/a&gt; in the software
  development profession, and how we need to take deliberate action to
  increase the proportion of underrepresented groups. This is all well
  and good, but naturally leads to the questions of what
  underrepresented groups we should be concerned about. In
  ThoughtWorks we've been using the term
  "historically-discriminated-against" &lt;a href="#footnote-credit"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; to
  help focus our thinking for one of the main drivers for embracing
  diversity. &lt;a href="#footnote-aspects"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity has a consistently sad record of pushing groups of
  humans down. Historically-discriminated-against groups include women
  pretty much everywhere, African-American and Native-Americans in the
  United States, lower castes in India, aboriginals in Australia,
  homosexuals everywhere&#x2026; sadly the list is long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically-discriminated-against groups are often minorities,
  but not always. Blacks in South Africa have always been a
  considerable majority, but are historically-discriminated-against.
  Often historically-discriminated-against people are visibly
  different, based on race or gender. But they can equally well not be
  as visible, such as religious groups or homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historic discrimination is the essence of why we should work
  to support fixing problems. One might argue that the
  under-representation of men in nursing is as problematic a diversity
  imbalance as that of women in tech. While I don't see a lack of male
  nurses as a good thing, I think it's less of a concern because
  men have not suffered the historic discrimination that women have.
  Similarly if someone discovered that green-eyed people were
  disproportionately rare in the software industry, again my concern
  would be less because of the lack of historic discrimination.
  (Although I would still find such a disproportion intriguing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an important point about the "historical" in this
  definition. Many historically-discriminated-against groups have
  legal and social protections from discrimination these days. In
  America it's now socially unacceptable to make public racist or sexist
  comments, and illegal to carry out most forms of racist or sexist
  discrimination. But you can't cure centuries of historic wrongs in
  just a few years. This is the fallacy of people who advocate for
  gender-blind and race-blind policies. It takes many generations to
  undo the effect of centuries of discrimination, so just because the
  law and society are beginning to catch up doesn't mean the work of
  supporting historically-discriminated-against groups can stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we see only &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-brogrammer-effect-women-are-a-small-and-shrinking-share-of-computer-workers/279611/"&gt;27%
  of software developers are women&lt;/a&gt; in world of 50% women, the fact
  that women are historically-discriminated-against is evidence that
  the effects of their historical oppression haven't yet been
  corrected. While some may argue that there's a biological
  explanation for the lack of women programmers, I consider that to be
  a treacherous argument. There's no evidence to support that women
  are less capable programmers (other than the circular one of their
  lack of numbers). Worse still, such biological and cultural
  arguments have a long history of being used to justify
  discrimination. So unless credible evidence appears, I think it's
  wise to consider that an underrepresentation of a
  historically-discriminated-against group is a sign that we haven't
  yet finished the task of correcting a long-running wrong. And until
  we do, our vision of a meritocratic profession will be undermined by
  the reality of the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-credit"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      The precise term was coined by Bill Kimmel inspired by one of
      our values statements of Social Responsibility: "We strive to
      redress historic discrimination, including that of race, gender
      and sexual orientation.". Similar phrases appear in various
      parts of the world, but this is the origin of our usage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-aspects"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      There are many aspects to diversity, which is why "diversity" is
      such a tricky word to work with. I often see articles extolling
      the benefits of diverse teams, where this diversity is looking
      for diversity of thought. This is valuable but different from a
      focus on the historically-discriminated-against. Fortunately
      these various aspects of diversity usually go together..
    &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bliki: Nexus7</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Nexus7.html"/>
    <updated>2013-10-08T11:01:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Nexus7.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I bought a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DVFLJDS?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00DVFLJDS"&gt; Google
  Nexus 7 tablet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;. I like to wait until I've used a device for
  a while before I post my experiences of it, but the disadvantage of
  that policy is that now the tablet I'm talking about has been
  superseded. That said, I'll pass on my comments anyway, since they
  may still be helpful to others considering their future tablet
  options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My driver for getting this device was two-fold. I got an Apple
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/iPad.html"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; just a couple of months after it first appeared.
  It's been a constant companion, but its age is showing. It's not
  just that it cannot run anything newer than IOS 5 (that's not a big
  deal to me), the major problem is that many websites will crash the browser
  these days (which I gather is due to memory limits). The second
  rationale was experimentation, I wanted to try Android &lt;a href="#footnote-original-android"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and also try the smaller 7" tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole I really like the nexus 7. The base Google UI
  is a touch better than Apple's. I miss the
  cross-application back button when I go back to the iPad. I also
  prefer Android's approach to completion in typing where they give
  you three words to choose from and don't automatically complete with
  the space bar (which regularly annoys me with IOS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feelings are more mixed about the 7" tablet size. I find that
  most of the time I mildly prefer the 7" due to its smaller size and lighter
  weight. However some of the time I strongly prefer the 10" size
  because of the bigger screen. There are times - some websites, pdf
  documents, or books with code or graphics - when that bigger screen
  is essential. The consequence of this is that despite the advantages
  of the smaller size I end up taking the 10" device on my travels for
  those occasions where I need the larger screen. If I could only have
  one tablet, it would have to be a 10", but I do use the 7" more
  often at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other downside to Android lies in the applications. There are
  some nice applications for IOS that I can't find alternatives I like
  on the Android. To be fair this could be due to familiarity and a
  need to spend a bit more time searching. I need to put more effort
  into checking out what's available before I decide whether to use
  Apple or Android when I buy a 10" device to replace my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-original-android"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      I first got an Android device at the Google IO conference in
      2009 (where Rebecca and I &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/ThoughtWorksAppEngineJava.html"&gt;spoke
      about cloud computing&lt;/a&gt;). This was what's since been called
      the &lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/google-ion-htc-magic/4505-6452_7-33665904.html"&gt;Google
      Ion&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed having a smart phone and the experience
      led me to upgrade my phone account to handle 3G - but the only
      way to do that was to get an iPhone, so that was the end of that
      Android experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: ThresholdTest</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ThresholdTest.html"/>
    <updated>2013-09-12T10:03:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ThresholdTest.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;A threshold test is a test inserted into a
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html"&gt;DeploymentPipeline&lt;/a&gt; that monitors some measurable
  phenomenon by comparing the value in the current build against a
  threshold value. Should the current build's value pass the
  threshold, the test fails, failing the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/thresholdTest/sketch.png" width="540"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common example use of threshold tests are in performance. The
  team takes a representative set of operations and times them. They
  then set a threshold test to fail should these operations take some
  significant amount of time greater than this current value.
  Thresholds like this are handy for spotting cases where a commit
  introduces a performance degradation. In data-intensive applications
  these often occur due to badly written queries or poor use of
  indexing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having a threshold test you can spot this kind of problem when it's
  first introduced. This makes it easier to fix, since you know it's
  this commit which caused the failure - which cuts down where you
  have to search for the problem. Furthermore maintaining a threshold test
  prevents these kinds of problems building up in the code base. If
  you have many of these poor queries, then it's easier for more to
  creep in since their effects are obscured by the ones already present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threshold tests can be used with &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html#MetricsAsARatchet"&gt;ratcheting&lt;/a&gt;,
  where you steadily tighten the threshold over time to improve the
  value. So each time you add a commit that improves performance,
  you'd lower the threshold. This should help gradually improve
  performance over time. Using threshold tests with ratcheting is
  particularly helpful when you begin in a poor place and starting a
  program of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when a threshold test will fail and the team
  decides the threshold is too aggressive and relaxes the threshold.
  Depending on the circumstances that may be the right thing to do -
 the threshold test helps here by making this decision a conscious one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="furtherReading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threshold tests are a way to follow the principles of "Favor
   tracking trends over absolute numbers" and "Use shorter tracking
   periods" from &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html"&gt;An Appropriate
   Use of Metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For general advice on testing cross-functional requirements,
   take a look at &lt;a href="/books/continuousDelivery.html"&gt;Chapter 9
   of Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bliki: PageObject</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html"/>
    <updated>2013-09-10T09:46:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;When you write tests against a web page, you need to refer to
  elements within that web page in order to click links and determine
  what's displayed. However, if you write tests that manipulate the
  HTML elements directly your tests will be brittle to changes in the
  UI. A page object wraps an HTML page, or fragment, with an application-specific
  API, allowing you to manipulate page elements without digging around
  in the HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img height="478" src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/pageObject/pageObject.png" width="540"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic rule of thumb for a page object is that it should allow
  a software client to do anything and see anything that a human can.
  It should also provide an interface that's easy to program to and
  hides the underlying widgetry in the window. So to access a text
  field you should have accessor methods that take and return a
  string, check boxes should use booleans, and buttons should be
  represented by action oriented method names. The page object should
  encapsulate the mechanics required to find and manipulate the data
  in the gui control itself. A good rule of thumb is to imagine
  changing the concrete control - in which case the page object
  interface shouldn't change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the term "page" object, these objects shouldn't usually
  be built for each page, but rather for the significant elements on a
  page &lt;a href="#footnote-panel-object"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. So a page showing multiple
  albums would have an album list page object containing several album
  page objects. There would probably also be a header page object and
  a footer page object. That said, some of the hierarchy of a complex
  UI is only there in order to structure the UI - such composite
  structures shouldn't be revealed by the page objects. The rule of
  thumb is to model the structure in the page that makes
  sense to the user of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly if you navigate to another page, the initial page
  object should return another page object for the new page &lt;a href="#footnote-return-type"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. In
  general page object operations should return fundamental types
  (strings, dates) or other page objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are differences of opinion on whether page objects should
  include assertions themselves, or just provide data for test scripts
  to do the assertions. Advocates of including assertions in page
  objects say that this helps avoid duplication of assertions in test
  scripts, makes it easier to provide better error messages, and
  supports a more &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html"&gt;TellDontAsk&lt;/a&gt; style API. Advocates of
  assertion-free page objects say that including assertions mixes the
  responsibilities of providing access to page data with assertion
  logic, and leads to a bloated page object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I favor having no assertions in page objects. I think you can avoid
  duplication by providing assertion libraries for common assertions -
  which can also make it easier to provide good diagnostics. &lt;a href="#footnote-assertions"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page objects are commonly used for testing, but should not make
  assertions themselves. Their responsibility is to provide access to
  the state of the underlying page. It's up to test clients to carry
  out the assertion logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've described this pattern in terms of HTML, but the same
  pattern applies equally well to any UI technology. I've seen this
  pattern used effectively to hide the details of a Java swing
  UI and I've no doubt it's been widely used with just about every
  other UI framework out there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrency issues are another topic that a page object can
  encapsulate. This may involve hiding the asynchrony in async
  operations that don't appear to the user as async. It may also
  involve encapsulating threading issues in UI frameworks where you
  have to worry about allocating behavior between UI and worker threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page objects are most commonly used in testing, but can also be
  used to provide a scripting interface on top of an application.
  Usually it's best to put a scripting interface underneath the UI,
  that's usually less complicated and faster. However with an
  application that's put too much behavior into the UI then using 
  page objects may make the best of a bad job. (But look to move that
  logic if you can, it will be better both for scripting and the long
  term health of the UI.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's common to write tests using some form of
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html"&gt;DomainSpecificLanguage&lt;/a&gt;, such as Cucumber or an internal
  DSL. If you do this it's best to layer the testing DSL over the page
  objects so that you have a parser that translates DSL statements
  into calls on the page object. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="soundbyte" style="padding-left: 5em; font-style: italic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If you have WebDriver APIs in your test methods, You're Doing It
    Wrong. -- &lt;a href="http://blog.rocketpoweredjetpants.com"&gt;Simon Stewart&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterns that aim to move logic out of UI elements (such as &lt;a href="/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html"&gt;Presentation Model&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html"&gt;Supervising
  Controller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html"&gt;Passive
  View&lt;/a&gt;) make it less useful to test through the UI and thus reduce
  the need for page objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Page objects are a classic example of encapsulation - they hide
  the details of the UI structure and widgetry from other components
  (the tests). It's a good design principle to look for situations
  like this as you develop - ask yourself "how can I hide some details from the
  rest of the software?" As with any encapsulation this yields two
  benefits. I've already stressed that by confining logic that
  manipulates the UI to a single place you can modify it there without
  affecting other components in the system. A consequential benefit is
  that it makes the client (test) code easier to understand because the
  logic there is about the intention of the test and not cluttered by
  UI details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="furtherReading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first described this pattern under the name &lt;a href="/eaaDev/WindowDriver.html"&gt;Window Driver&lt;/a&gt;. However since then
    the term "page object" was popularized by the Selenium web testing
    framework and that's become the generally used name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects"&gt;Selenium's
    wiki&lt;/a&gt; strongly
    encourages using page objects and provides advice on how they
    should be used. It also favors assertion-free page objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

     Perryn Fowler, Pete Hodgson, and Simon Stewart gave particularly
     useful comments on drafts of this post - although as usual I owe
     much to various denizens of ThoughtWorks's internal software
     development list for their suggestions and corrections.

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-panel-object"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      There's an argument here that the name "page object" is
      misleading because it makes you think you should have just one
      page object per page. Something like "panel object" would be
      better - but the term "page object" is what's become accepted.
      Another illustration of why naming is one of the &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html"&gt;TwoHardThings&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-return-type"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      Having page objects be responsible for creating other page
      objects in response to things like navigation is common advice.
      However some practitioners prefer that page objects return some
      generic browser context, and the tests control which page
      objects to build on top of that context based on the flow of the
      test (particularly conditional flows). Their preference is based
      on the fact that the test script knows what pages are expected
      next and this knowledge doesn't need to be duplicated in the
      page objects themselves. They increase their preference when using
      statically typed languages which usually reveal page navigations
      in type signatures. 
      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-assertions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
      One form of assertions is fine even for people like me who
      generally favor a no-assertion style. These assertions are those
      that check the invariants of a page or the application at this
      point, rather than specific things that a test is probing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: TellDontAsk</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html"/>
    <updated>2013-09-05T11:39:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Tell-Don't-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that
  object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions that
  operate on that data. It reminds us that rather than asking an
  object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an
  object what to do. This encourages to move behavior into an object
  to go with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/tellDontAsk/sketch.png" width="340"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's clarify with an example. Let's imagine we need to monitor
  certain values, signaling an alarm should the value rise above a
  certain limit. If we write this in an "ask" style, we might have a
  data structure to represent these things&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;class AskMonitor...
  private int value;
  private int limit;
  private boolean isTooHigh;
  private String name;
  private Alarm alarm;

  public AskMonitor (String name, int limit, Alarm alarm) {
    this.name = name;
    this.limit = limit;
    this.alarm = alarm;
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#x2026;and combine this with some accessors to get at this data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;class AskMonitor...
  public int getValue() {return value;}
  public void setValue(int arg) {value = arg;}
  public int getLimit() {return limit;}
  public String getName()  {return name;}
  public Alarm getAlarm() {return alarm;}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would then use the data structure like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;    AskMonitor am = new AskMonitor("Time Vortex Hocus", 2, alarm);
    am.setValue(3);
    if (am.getValue() &amp;gt; am.getLimit()) 
      am.getAlarm().warn(am.getName() + " too high");
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tell Don't Ask" reminds us to instead put the behavior inside the
 monitor object itself (using the same fields).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;class TellMonitor...
  public void setValue(int arg) {
    value = arg;
    if (value &amp;gt; limit) alarm.warn(name + " too high");
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which would be used like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;    TellMonitor tm = new TellMonitor("Time Vortex Hocus", 2, alarm);
    tm.setValue(3);
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people find tell-don't-ask to be a useful principle. One of
 the fundamental principles of object-oriented design is to combine
 data and behavior, so that the basic elements of our system (objects)
 combine both together. This is often a good thing because this data
 and the behavior that manipulates them are tightly coupled: changes
 in one cause changes in the other, understanding one helps you
 understand the other. Things that are tightly coupled should be in
 the same component. Thinking of tell-don't-ask is a way to help
 programmers to see how they can increase this co-location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But personally, I don't use tell-dont-ask. I do look to co-locate
 data and behavior, which often leads to similar results. One thing I
 find troubling about tell-dont-ask is that I've seen it encourage
 people to become &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/GetterEradicator.html"&gt;GetterEradicators&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to get rid of
 all query methods. But there are times when objects collaborate
 effectively by providing information. A good example are objects that
 take input information and transform it to simplify their clients,
 such as using &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EmbeddedDocument.html"&gt;EmbeddedDocument&lt;/a&gt;. I've seen code get into
 convolutions of only telling where suitably responsible query methods
 would simplify matters &lt;a href="#footnote-trades"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. For me,
 tell-don't-ask is a stepping stone towards co-locating behavior and
 data, but I don't find it a point worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="furtherReading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This principle is most often associated with Andy Hunt and
   "Prag" Dave Thomas (The Pragmatic Programmers). They describe it in
   a &lt;a href="http://media.pragprog.com/articles/jan_03_enbug.pdf"&gt;IEEE Software
   column&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask"&gt;post on their
   website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-trades"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
     And indeed even the more fundamental principle of co-locating
     data and behavior should sometimes be dropped in favor of other
     concerns - such as layering. Good design is all about trade-offs,
     and co-locating data and behavior is just one factor to bear in
     mind.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the great frustrations of the software industry is that we don&amp;#8217;t have properly built studies to figure out whether development tools and techniques such as object-oriented programming, test-driven development, or even high-level languages are good for us. Regularly we see improperly built studies that do so - often these are done poorly because they rely on a bogus measure of productivity (such as Lines of Code per staff day). 10 years ago today, my frustration led me to publish my bliki post &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html'&gt;CannotMeasureProductivity&lt;/a&gt;. I think this post is sadly just as sound today as it was a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Bliki: GivenWhenThen</title>

    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Given-When-Then is a style of representing tests - or as its
  advocates would say - specifying a system's behavior using &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html"&gt;SpecificationByExample&lt;/a&gt;. It's an
  approach developed by &lt;a href="http://dannorth.net/about/"&gt;Dan North&lt;/a&gt; and Chris Matts as part of
  &lt;a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/"&gt;Behavior-Driven
  Development&lt;/a&gt; (BDD).  &lt;a href="#footnote-ivan"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; It appears as a structuring approach
  for many testing frameworks such as Cucumber. You can also look at
  it as a reformulation of the &lt;a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html"&gt;Four-Phase
  Test&lt;/a&gt; pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essential idea is to break down writing a scenario (or test) into three
  sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;given&lt;/b&gt; part describes the state of the world before
    you begin the behavior you're specifying in this scenario. You can
    think of it as the pre-conditions to the test.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;when&lt;/b&gt; section is that behavior that you're
    specifying.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finally the &lt;b&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; section describes the changes you
    expect due to the specified behavior. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we're talking about using examples as specifications, it
  makes sense to show this with an
  example &lt;a href="#footnote-example-credit"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Feature: User trades stocks
  Scenario: User requests a sell before close of trading
    Given I have 100 shares of MSFT stock
       And I have 150 shares of APPL stock
       And the time is before close of trading

    When I ask to sell 20 shares of MSFT stock
     
     Then I should have 80 shares of MSFT stock
      And I should have 150 shares of APPL stock
      And a sell order for 20 shares of MSFT stock should have been executed
  &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example uses Cucumber &lt;a href="#footnote-gherkin"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, which a popular way of writing
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessFacingTest.html"&gt;BusinessFacingTests&lt;/a&gt; but you can use the Given-When-Then
  style with any kind of tests. Some people like to put
  Given-When-Then as comments to mark informal blocks inside unit
  tests &lt;a href="#footnote-frameworks"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. I've also seen this convention
  to structure informal prose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's usual with this approach to see "ands" used to combine
  multiple expressions within each clause. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've characterized the given as a description of the
  pre-condition state because that's the way I prefer to think of it.
  A testing framework, however, interprets the givens as a set of
  commands to bring the system-under-test into the correct state before
  executing the when command. (Which is why other naming conventions
  often call this "setup".) Testing frameworks provide various query
  methods for the then commands - these should
  be free of side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Given-When-Then style is symptomatic to BDD, the basic
  idea is pretty common when writing tests or specification by
  example. &lt;a href="/books/xunit"&gt;Meszaros&lt;/a&gt; describes the pattern as &lt;a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Four%20Phase%20Test.html"&gt;Four-Phase
  Test&lt;/a&gt;. His four phases are Setup (Given), Exercise (When), Verify
  (Then) and Teardown &lt;a href="#footnote-teardown"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;. Bill Wake came up
  with the formulation as &lt;a href="http://xp123.com/articles/3a-arrange-act-assert/"&gt;Arrange, Act, Assert&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-ivan"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      In review comments on this, Dan credits Ivan Moore for a
      significant amount of inspiration in coming up with this.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-example-credit"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
       from &lt;a href="http://blog.thepete.net/"&gt;Pete Hodgson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-gherkin"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
      Or to be strict it uses Gherkin, which is the name of Cucumber's
      DSL.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-frameworks"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;4: &lt;/span&gt;
      Test frameworks tend to follow either
  naming style of xunit or BDD, the latter tend to name methods in the
  Given-When-Then style.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-teardown"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;5: &lt;/span&gt;
      Teardown isn't always needed when implementing
  tests (particularly if you are using &lt;a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Automated%20Teardown.html"&gt;Automated
  Teardown&lt;/a&gt;) and doesn't add much to the communication aspect of
  specification by example. So it's reasonable to see it missing from
  the BDD style.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: UserDefinedField</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserDefinedField.html"/>
    <updated>2013-07-23T10:36:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserDefinedField.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;A common feature in software systems is to allow users to define
  their own fields in data structures. Consider an address book -
  there's a host of things that you might want to add. With new social
  networks popping up every day, users might want to add a new field
  for a Bunglr id to their contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For in-memory purposes, often the best way to do this is to allow
  classes to include a hashmap field for user-defined fields (a
  pattern Kent Beck calls &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013476904X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=013476904X"&gt;Variable State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;# ruby
class Contact
  attr_accessor :firstname, :lastname

  def initialize
    @data = {}
  end

  def [] arg
    return @data[arg]
  end
  def []= key, value
    @data[key] = value
  end
end

aCustomer = Contact.new
aCustomer.firstname = "Martin"
aCustomer[:bunglrId] = 'fowl'
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a setup like this you can add affordances to your UI to
  allow users to attach new fields to objects. If you want common user
  defined fields, you can use a class variable to keep a list of
  common keys for the hashmap. There is some awkwardness in that
  regular fields are accessed differently to user-defined fields, but
  depending on your language even this can be overcome. If your
  language supports &lt;a href="/dslCatalog/dynamicReception.html"&gt;Dynamic Reception&lt;/a&gt; then you
  use this to access the hashmap with regular field access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;class Contact...
  def method_missing(meth, *args)
    if @data.has_key? meth
      return @data[meth]
    else
      super
    end
  end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the trickiest part of this is figuring out how to persist
  this. If you're using a schemaless database, then it's usually
  straightforward - you just add the user-defined keys to your
  application defined ones. The trickiness comes from a database with
  a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless/"&gt;storage schema&lt;/a&gt;, particularly a relational database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the best option is to use a &lt;a href="/eaaCatalog/serializedLOB.html"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serialized LOB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
  essentially creating a large text column into which you store the
  user-defined fields as a JSON or XML document. Many databases these
  days offer pretty nice support for this approach, including support
  for indexing and querying based on the data structure within the
  LOB. However such support, if available, is usually more awkward
  than using fields. &lt;a href="#footnote-index"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another route is using some kind of &lt;b&gt;attribute table&lt;/b&gt;. A table
  might look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;CREATE TABLE ContactAttributes (
  contactId   INTEGER, 
  attribute   TEXT, 
  value       TEXT, 
  PRIMARY KEY (contactId, attribute))
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, querying and indexing are awkward. Queries can involve a
  good bit of extra joins that can get rather messy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pre-defined custom fields&lt;/b&gt; offer another system. Here you set the
  schema up with fields like &lt;code&gt;custom_field_1&lt;/code&gt; (and perhaps
  &lt;code&gt;custom_field_1_name&lt;/code&gt;. You are limited to only the number
  of custom fields per instance that you have pre-defined. As usual
  indexing and querying are awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a attribute table or pre-defined custom fields you may
  choose to have different columns for different SQL data types. So
  pre-defined fields might be &lt;code&gt;integer_1, integer_2,
  text_1&#x2026;&lt;/code&gt;, or a attribute table might have multiple value
  fields (&lt;code&gt;text_value, integer_value&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;dynamic schema&lt;/b&gt; is an approach that's often overlooked.
  To do this you set things up so that when someone adds a field, you
  use an &lt;code&gt;alter table&lt;/code&gt; statement to add that field to the
  table. Our &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management"&gt;Mingle team&lt;/a&gt; does this and have been
  happy with how it's worked out. &lt;a href="#footnote-mingle"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; The new fields can be indexed and
  queried just the same as application-defined fields. This does mean
  all instances get all fields, so is less handy if you get a lot of
  variance between instances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your persistance scheme choices will be affected by what you use
  for relational mapping. User-defined fields aren't the most
  well-trod parts of the relational mapping problem, so there's a lot
  of variation in support from different relational mapping libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User-defined fields are a similar problem to non-uniform types &lt;a href="#footnote-non-uniform"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.
  Both problems lead to the need for a more flexible schema, or indeed
  a truly schemaless approach (although remember that &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless/"&gt;schemaless doesn't
  mean you don't have a schema&lt;/a&gt;). If you have non-uniform types
  that aren't changing at the users' behest, then one of the
  inheritance oriented patterns may make sense. (&lt;a href="/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html"&gt;Single Table
  Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/eaaCatalog/classTableInheritance.html"&gt;Class Table
  Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="/eaaCatalog/concreteTableInheritance.html"&gt;Concrete Table
  Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-index"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      Bret Taylor &lt;a href="http://backchannel.org/blog/friendfeed-schemaless-mysql"&gt;describes
      a scheme&lt;/a&gt; for indexing fields in a such a scheme by building
      separate index tables for each indexable field.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-mingle"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      Mingle's approach is actually a bit more involved than just
      adding fields to an existing table. Mingle's central record type
      is a card (which represents stories, tasks etc). The fields on a
      card vary by project and you can have many projects in the same
      database. So rather than use a single card table, mingle creates
      a new table for each project's card. It then adds fields
      dynamically to this table as users desire.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-non-uniform"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
     Non-uniform types are types where instances use a small and very
     different selection of fields. Sometimes these are called sparse
     tables, because if you look at the whole table each row only uses
     a small number of a large list of columns. The difference between
     non-uniform types and user-defined fields is that non-uniform
     types have all the potential fields known to developers, while
     user-defined fields allow fields to be created that developers
     will never know about.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: StoryPoint</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StoryPoint.html"/>
    <updated>2013-07-16T10:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StoryPoint.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Story points are a common name for sizing stories in agile
  projects. Combined with &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html"&gt;XpVelocity&lt;/a&gt; they provide a
  technique to aid planning by providing a forecast of when stories
  can be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When estimating work, a common approach is to estimate in terms
  staff-hours, such as a programmer saying "this will take me two days
  to do". Many people in the early days of agile, especially those in
  the &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html"&gt;ExtremeProgramming&lt;/a&gt; community, found that teams struggled to
  come up with useful estimates using this approach, even when they
  applied an approach of &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/IdealTime.html"&gt;IdealTime&lt;/a&gt;. We found the
  most effective way to estimate was to size stories relative to each
  other, and then use past experience to determine how much could be
  done in an iteration. &lt;a href="#footnote-name"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the points for a story, we compare rough relative
  sizes. If we are estimating the "fibble the foobar" story, we look
  for a story of similar size that we've already estimated. We sense
  it's about the same size as "flipping the synergy bit". Then we look
  at the story point score for "flipping the synergy bit" and
  score the "fibble the foobar" the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team using story points uses a small range of story points to
  work with. Common examples might be 1,2,4,8 or 1,2,3,5,8 &lt;a href="#footnote-fib"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.
  Often the top number in the series represents "too big" and should
  be broken down further. &lt;a href="#footnote-too-big"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allocating story points should be rapid activity. Discussion
  should only break out when people have contrasting views on the
  estimate, in which case its useful to have a discussion as it
  usually means that something about the story isn't clear. Using a
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ThrownEstimate.html"&gt;ThrownEstimate&lt;/a&gt; is a good technique to move things along
  quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To form a plan with time, you use &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html"&gt;XpVelocity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams don't like using story points, preferring instead to
  use &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StoryCounting.html"&gt;StoryCounting&lt;/a&gt;. I don't have a preference between the
  two - both seem to work equally well so it's up to the team to try
  out and go with whichever suits them best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="furtherReading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/resources/how-do-you-estimate-agile-project"&gt;ThoughtWorks ebook on estimation&lt;/a&gt; provides includes a good
    Q&amp;amp;A on story points. Kent and I discussed them in more depth 
    in the &lt;a href="/books/pxp.html"&gt;tasteful green book&lt;/a&gt;. Most
    books that talk about planning and estimation in an agile context
    discuss story points in more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      "Story Points" is the most common name that I hear these days,
      but various terms have been used over the years, often with
      whimsical names that emphasized their arbitrary nature. I
      particularly like Joseph Pelrine's &lt;b&gt;gummi bears&lt;/b&gt; and
      Josh Kerievsky's: &lt;b&gt;NUTs&lt;/b&gt; (Nebulous Units of Time).
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-fib"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;2: &lt;/span&gt;
      This is a Fibonacci sequence
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-too-big"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;3: &lt;/span&gt;
      Using the top number as too big is saying that a story
  sized at '8' really means '8 or more'. If you do this beware of
  using this top number when making forecasts of things like
  completion time, since '8' can turn into all sorts of numbers when
  it finally gets broken down. It's usually better to explicitly say
  its too big to be estimated rather than use a false marker number.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Bliki: StoryCounting</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StoryCounting.html"/>
    <updated>2013-07-16T10:09:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StoryCounting.html</id>
    <category term="bliki"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Story counting is a technique for planning and estimation.
  Similarly to &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StoryPoint.html"&gt;StoryPoints&lt;/a&gt; it works with
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html"&gt;XpVelocity&lt;/a&gt; to help you figure out how many
  stories you can deliver in a fixed period of time. It differs,
  however, in that you just consider the number of stories per unit of
  time and (mostly) ignore their relative sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale for story counting comes from experience. I've
  heard several teams look at their history and find that over the
  course of the project, their estimates from using story points are
  no more accurate than if they had simply counted how many
  stories were in each iteration. Given that, the effort of
  calculating story points isn't worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using story counting does not imply that all the stories are
  roughly the same size (although some teams do work that way).
  Stories can still vary in size, but over time the bigger and smaller
  stories will cancel each other out, hence a simple count ends up the
  same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean that you discard all consideration of relative
  size. Teams usually put enough effort in to ensure that the stories
  are within an order of magnitude of each other in terms of effort
  (so if they were given story points, they would be in a 1-8 point
  range). &lt;a href="#footnote-sizing"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With story counting, you use velocity in much the same way as usual,
  the only difference is that velocity is just a sum of stories rather
  than a sum of story points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of estimating with story points is that it
  helps identify poorly understood stories. So when using story
  counting you need to ensure there is some mechanism to spot
  stories with hidden blobs of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the teams I've come across using story counting are teams
  that have already been good at using story points, so it may be that
  story counting is a technique for more advanced teams. I've found
  teams work well with both story points and story counting and have
  no preference between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="furtherReading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/resources/how-do-you-estimate-agile-project"&gt;ThoughtWorks
    ebook on estimation&lt;/a&gt; has a couple of articles on using story
    counting based on experiences with ThoughtWorks projects. Josh
    Kerievsky has a &lt;a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/"&gt;good
    explanation of his switch&lt;/a&gt; from story points to story
    counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-sizing"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      There's still a danger that you can get into difficulty by
  doing all the small stories first, thus getting a false picture of
  progress. If you're concerned about this you can do a rough sizing
  of stories (such as "T-shirt sizing" into Small, Medium, Large, and
  Extra Large). Unlike Story Points, don't worry about the proportions
  between the sizes, all you need is to look to see if there are
  imbalances in the distribution of stories over time, such as all the
  extra-large stories at the end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Thoughts on Edward Snowden</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/snips/201306100949.html"/>

    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2013-06-10:Thoughts-on-Edward-Snowden</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This last weekend was the ThoughtWorks North American awayday. Following the suicide earlier this year of Aaron Swartz, we had a theme around the role of the internet and the software profession to combat overreaching government and corporate power; featuring speeches by &lt;a href='http://joyb.blogspot.com'&gt;Birgitta Jonsdottir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/justleft'&gt;Michael Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, and (by video link) Julian Assange. It was merely a happy coincidence that this weekend corresponded with successive leaks of troubling activities by government agencies under the Obama administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I boarded the flight home, I read the news of Edward Snowden&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance'&gt;account of why he made these leaks&lt;/a&gt;, and furthermore, why he chose to publicly take responsibility for them. Based on the information I currently have, I am struck with admiration for the courage and thoughtfulness of Edward Snowden&amp;#8217;s actions. The path of a whistleblower is not an easy route, because it rests on the difficult dilemma between breaking the trust of the community we work with and our responsibility to our wider community: our country and humanity as a whole. I have had mixed feelings about some of the whistleblowing against the US government in recent years, some cases I&amp;#8217;ve admired, but in other cases I&amp;#8217;ve felt that the secrets revealed have not measured up to the high standards required by breaking that smaller trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Edward Snowden&amp;#8217;s case, these secrets so far have met that high standard. I am concerned both by these actions of the US government and by the secrecy that&amp;#8217;s obscured these actions - a secrecy that makes it impossible for we the people to debate the correctness of our representatives&amp;#8217; policies. I hope we the people will support a public servant who put his responsibility to us over the government that serves us.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>A short statement on the Adria Richards / Pycon incident</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/snips/201304150952.html"/>
    <updated>2013-04-15T09:52:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2013-04-15:A-short-statement-on-the-Adria-Richards---Pycon-incident</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I watched in depressed fascination at the internet explosion about Adria Richards and her reaction to offensive comments made in the audience of the Pycon conference. (If you would like more information on this incident I would suggest starting with the &lt;a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/26/adria-richards-gets-rape-threats-for-speaking-out-about-workplace-sexism'&gt;Guardian article&lt;/a&gt;. ) Although I did contemplate writing something about it, I felt that I didn&amp;#8217;t have anything new or constructive to say. I don&amp;#8217;t really have anything terribly enlightening to say now, but I do feel the need to state my opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the supreme issue here is the appalling internet attacks on Ms Richards, which included a barrage of viciousness that included rape threats, death threats, publishing her private information, and a DDOS attack on her employer. In the discussion over these events, many people have spent energy discussing such things as whether the jokes that triggered all this were truly offensive, and whether Ms Richards&amp;#8217;s reaction was appropriate. Even if we were to accept that her action, a tweet including a photograph of the jokers, was an overreaction which violated reasonable etiquette - any wrong that she had done is insignificant compared to the wrong heaped upon her by those attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long despaired of the &lt;a href='/bliki/NetNastiness.html'&gt;net nastiness&lt;/a&gt; that hangs over our profession and how its alienating atmosphere contributes to our &lt;a href='/bliki/DiversityImbalance.html'&gt;diversity imbalance&lt;/a&gt;. This incident sadly makes clear the misogynistic streak in the tech world and further deters women from speaking out against it. I have no solutions to offer, but will continue to listen to historically disadvantaged groups and hope to be able to support those trying to correct these problems. I know that many of my colleagues at ThoughtWorks are also eager to see this disease eradicated and for our profession to actually approach being the meritocracy it likes to think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to state a loud &amp;#8220;+1&amp;#8221; to Alexis Ohanian for &lt;a href='http://alexisohanian.com/dear-fellow-geeks-what-the-fuck'&gt;eloquently expressing much of my feelings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 11 Jan 2007&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"'War and Peace' is a wonderful book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Let me see... pity this book has such a tattered cover"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="quote-attribution"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sentences, each uses the word 'book'. We glance over
combinations like this
every day without remarking that the word 'book' means something
completely different in each of those sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first sentence 'book' refers to a literary work, one
that's been with us for over a hundred years. In the second sentence
'book' now refers to a physical object that's probably been around for
a lot less. I can easily destroy the latter in my fire, but the former
isn't touched by my flames and will doubtless last longer than I will.
I can put the former on my hard disk with many siblings that
collectively weigh less than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular ambiguity is startlingly common in natural
language. Think about words like 'car', 'oak', and 'programmer'.
Trying to straighten this out can easily lead you into the darker
corners of semantics in philosophy. For the moment, I'll just explain
how I think about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word 'book' is a term that can refer to multiple
	concepts. The two sentences above illustrate two concepts that
	'book' refers to: the literary work and the physical copy. Since
	most of my readers are programmers I'll use a programming analogy
	and say that there are two distinct classes both of which are called
	'book'. We can disambiguate them by referring to them as the classes
	LiteraryWork and PhysicalCopy. When in the first sentence I
	say that 'War and Peace' is a book, I'm saying that 'War and Peace'
	is an instance of the class LiteraryWork. The second sentence refers
	to the properties of an instance of PhysicalCopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two concepts are not independent. Unlike a homonym like
right and right (the opposites of left and wrong), these two concepts
have a close relationship &lt;a href="#footnote-polysemy"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. A book [PhysicalCopy] carries on it a
rendering of the book [LiteraryWork]. So I might say that my War and
Peace has a tattered cover. Similarly my Subaru Legacy [instance of
physical car] has a relationship with Subaru Legacy [instance of car
model]. Indeed we might say that the type of my car is Subaru Legacy
[car model]. This kind of relationship is very common and is familiar to people
who do any kind of object or data modeling. You often see similar
structures involving things like Product and Product Type. I wouldn't
use the terms Book and Book Type, but it's fundamentally the same relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend time modeling, or programming, in almost any domain and you'll
reach a point where you have to take some common term in that domain
and realize it denotes two separate concepts which mean separate
classes (or tables) with different names in your code. When you get
homonyms in your domain language, it's often because the terms are
	used differently in different contexts - what Eric
	Evans calls Bounded Contexts. As Jim Odell liked to point out: "Mary
	had a little lamb" means quite different things to a veterinarian than
	to a restaurateur. The trouble with the type-instance homonym is
	that it occurs even within very tight bounded contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My purpose here isn't to talk much further about modeling these
	kind of situations, that's quite a topic on its own, but to reflect
	on the ambiguity that this common type of homonym causes. The
	really interesting thing about this ambiguity is how &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; trouble
	it causes. Humans seem to have no trouble at all switching between
	the multiple concepts and only rarely getting tripped up in the
	process. What's worse, if you actively try to use different terms in
	everyday conversation, it's nearly impossible to keep it up. I
	certainly tried, both in conversation and writing and quickly
	realized it was a lost cause. Not just did I not have the discipline
	but it made me sound like someone with some obscure mental
	condition. (The type-instance case isn't the only one with this
	property, as the phrase "go through the door we painted last
	week" suggests.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a particularly fascinating case of this in my own
	specialty of object-oriented design. We often talk about things like
	"add a method to an object". Yet, of course, we don't add methods to
	objects, we add them to classes. At some point in your career you've
	been the pedant who's pointed that out in a meeting. You've also
	effortlessly glossed over that point in countless conversations since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I came to the conclusion that we absolutely have to be aware
of this homonym. We need to represent the concepts separately and with
different names in our software. But we shouldn't expect to make a
distinction between them in our conversation unless we're in a context
where there is a real danger of confusion, because most of the time
our brains resolve the ambiguity automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean in the context of a
	&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html"&gt;UbiquitousLanguage&lt;/a&gt;? Firstly we have to do the modeling
	and realize we have different concepts (aware of the homonym). We
	then come up with names for the different concepts that we'll use in
	our Ubiquitous Language and thus in the software
	representation. When coming up with these names, I like to avoid the
	bare homonym: so I wouldn't use "book" in the library context,
	preferring something like 'Literary Work' and 'Physical Copy'. These
	disambiguating terms need to be comprehensible to the domain experts,
	as with anything else in the Ubiquitous Language. Therefore the
	domain experts need to be aware of the homonym and help come up with
	the new terms. We then use the new terms whenever we need the
	precision we gain. However we should be wary of trying to completely
	exorcise the homonym. It effectively becomes a synonym for each of
	the new terms. So if a domain person says "a book has authors" we
	might say "you mean a literary work there, right?" Remember that it
	will feel unnatural to everyone to not use the homonym term, so apply
	the precision with a light touch. Fortunately awareness is 90% of
	the battle here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consequence of this homonym is that you should always
	have your antenna scanning for it - particularly in the early days of
	working in a new domain. Usually it occurs in terms that are
	absolutely central to that domain - as with books and
	libraries. I've liked using informal class diagrams to model a
	ubiquitous language and I've found it does a good job of rooting out
	these kinds of homonyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="footnote-list-item" id="footnote-polysemy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="num"&gt;1: &lt;/span&gt;
      Jim White emailed me to let me know that in Linguistics, the
      term "polysemy" is sometimes used to indicate to indicate a word
      that has different, but related, meanings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I was asked to kick off this track with an introductory talk for an hour giving an outline to the important issues in thinking about NoSQL. I talk about the origins of NoSQL, forms of NoSQL data models, the way many NoSQL databases consider the problem of consistency, and the importance of Polyglot Persistence. I was pretty happy with how this turned out and think it&amp;#8217;s a good way to spend an hour if you want to start a journey in understanding NoSQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a video of a &lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191kCkNya5Q&amp;amp;amp;list=PLEx5khR4g7PJmH05qNUmmo8WzSSaJIzLj&amp;amp;amp;index=7'&gt;panel of NoSQL vendors&lt;/a&gt; that I participated on. This wasn&amp;#8217;t a great discussion - lots of talking past each other, but maybe worth a look for people who are already into the NoSQL world.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like many of us, my colleague &lt;a href='http://thekua.com/atwork'&gt;Patrick Kua&lt;/a&gt; has seen a lot of use of metrics. Management love their metrics. The thinking goes something like this, &amp;#8220;We need a number to measure how we&#x2019;re doing. Numbers focus people and help us measure success.&amp;#8221; Whilst well intentioned, management by numbers unintuitively leads to problematic behavior and ultimately detracts from broader project and organizational goals. Metrics inherently aren&#x2019;t a bad thing; just often, inappropriately used. &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html'&gt;This essay&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates many of the issues caused by management&#x2019;s traditional use of metrics and offers an alternative to address these dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Big Data&amp;#8221; has leapt rapidly into one of the most hyped terms in our industry, yet the hype should not blind people to the fact that this is a genuinely important shift about the role of data in the world. The amount, speed, and value of data sources is rapidly increasing. Data management has to change in five broad areas: extraction of data from a wider range of sources, changes to the logistics of data management with new database and integration approaches, the use of agile principles in running analytics projects, an emphasis on techniques for data interpretation to separate signal from noise, and the importance of well-designed visualization to make that signal more comprehensible. Summing up this means we don&amp;#8217;t need big analytics projects, instead we want the new data thinking to permeate our regular work. &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/bigData'&gt;(go to the infodeck)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

A core point of the deck is that for the best user-experience you need several native applications, but this is expensive. To reduce cost a mobile web application works on all suitable devices, but a web-app limits your user-interface. The result is an unavoidable choice between user-experience and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can&amp;#8217;t make that trade-off go away, we can turn a binary choice into a more graduated scale by developing hybrid applications that mix web and native technologies. At ThoughtWorks we&amp;#8217;ve been pursuing this path on various client projects, with some success. We&amp;#8217;ve now developed enough understanding on how to approach a hybrid application to make it worth sharing some code, so we recently released Calatrava, which is a framework to enable this web-native interoperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calatrava is suitable for applications with significant client-side domain logic and when the application a channel for your product rather than the product itself. It is not suitable if most of your code is UI code (such as a game) or if a web app provides a sufficiently good user-experience. Calatrava is probably most valuable when you want to pursue an incremental release strategy, such as &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/mobileImplStrategy.html#cover-your-bases'&gt;cover-your-bases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information look at the &lt;a href='http://calatrava.github.com/'&gt;calatrava home page on github&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href='http://overwatering.org/blog/2012/10/announcing-calatrava/'&gt;launch announcement by maintainer Giles Alexander&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s also an overview on a &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/articles/multiMobile/#calatrava'&gt;single infodeck slide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Mountain Lion and Nokogiri</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/snips/201208142012.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-14T20:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2012-08-14:Mountain-Lion-and-Nokogiri</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was the day I attempted the upgrade to Mountain Lion. Upgrading all the way from Snow Leopard (long story). The tedious first step is making sure I have backups, usually multiple backups, in addition to the ones I keep by default. Computers hate me, so I&amp;#8217;ve learned to be paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first serious hitch was with Aperture. I&amp;#8217;d bought a download ages ago, when the route was to download a trial version and buy a product key. I still have the key, but there&amp;#8217;s no place to download the trial version from. Fortunately there was a very helpful man on Apple&amp;#8217;s telephone support who solved that one. +1 to him for being so helpful, but -2 for Apple for making it hard in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My more serious trouble was with Nokogiri, ruby&amp;#8217;s XML processing library. Since almost all my website is XML transformed to HTML via Nokogiri and Ruby, this is rather crucial to me. But I had no end of trouble finding some way to get Nokogiri to install and work. Looking out on the web there are several pages of advice, with different combinations of animals to sacrifice in various orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I got it working, but not in such a way that I have a confident trail for others to follow. I installed XCode command line tools, later the full XCode itself (don&amp;#8217;t know if that was a factor). I initially used homebrew for supporting libraries but without success. I tried using rvm, but it failed (and I backed it out). In the end I installed libxml2 and libxslt using Macports and got it all working on the installed ruby 1.8.7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that this is just early days of Mountain Lion, but the situation is really too messy. It&amp;#8217;s very troubling that the default install of ruby is still the elderly 1.8.7. I do need to share my scripts from time to time with others who are not active rubyists. It would be nice if there was a simpler installation process for them than my worry-ridden afternoon. I find myself pining for the days of the one-click windows install.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

They have spent many years helping organizations explore agile development and I&amp;#8217;ve always found their opinions worth listening to. When I get requests to review articles I rarely have time to read them, but a recent request by this pair piqued my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read their draft on the stages of agile fluency, I immediately offerred to publish it on my site. The article looks at how teams pass through four stages of fluency with agile methods. Each stage brings benefits, but demands investment. Not all teams should go through all the stages. The model they&amp;#8217;ve come up with is nicely simple and resonates with tales told by my colleagues. I think it provides a good framework for thinking about the style of agile development you are at and where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retreaded: RigorousAgile</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RigorousAgile.html"/>
    <updated>2012-07-26T15:24:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2012-07-26:Retreaded--RigorousAgile</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 29 May 2005&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often run into a complaint that agile methods don't have a
	rigorous definition. The complainer may talk about how this means
	that you can't tell if a particular team is using an agile method or
	not. They may also say that this makes it hard to teach people how
	to do agile methods - what's the curriculum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some degree I do feel the pain of this complaint - but
	I accept there is no cure. This lack of rigorousness is part of the
	defining nature of agile methods, part of its core philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental problems of thought processes in general -
and of software development in particular - is the very varied nature
of the settings. Different kinds of systems have different kinds of
pressures and forces, which makes it very difficult to come up with a
rigorous statement of what to do that's sufficient to cover them. This
effect is compounded by the fact that software development is such a
people-oriented activity, and people are naturally &lt;a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear%2c+first-order+components+in+software+development"&gt;inconsistent

and highly variable&lt;/a&gt;. The conclusion that agilists made from this
is that's its not effective to try and bind software development to a
rigorous process, because that's ignoring the essential nature of the
primary (human) components that will execute that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It's probably because our profession is to work with computers
	is what leads us to want to program human systems the same way that
	we program computers - despite the fact that they are so different.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that agile methods fundamentally expect
	teams to decide what process to follow and furthermore expect teams
	to actively and regularly change their process. Any attempt to
	define a rigorous process that can be tested for conformance runs
	contrary to this philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't deny that this is frustrating. How can you do a survey on
	whether agile methods are more effective that alternatives, or
	whether Extreme Programming is more effective than Scrum, when you
	can't get a clear definition of what Scrum is in the first place? If
	a client wants a system built using Extreme Programming how can they
	tell if it's really being done?. There is a sense of "I know it when
	I see it",  but it requires an
	experienced practitioner to have that sense and even then there's
	lots of room for such practitioners to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have an answer to this conundrum. Indeed I don't think
	there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an answer. It's a an unfortunate consequence of the
	activity itself, just as getting wet is an unavoidable consequence
	of swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

So I&amp;#8217;m late in mentioning that &lt;a href='http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321826620'&gt;NoSQL Distilled is now available for pre-order on InformIT&lt;/a&gt;. Its ship date is August 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pre-order you can get 35% off by entering discount code FOWLER6626 during checkout (this offer expires on August 17). InformIT is also running an offer where you get a 30 day trial to Safari Books Online if you place an order on InformIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has now completed production and has gone off to the printers. As I understand it the final ebook will appear when the printed book appears on August 17. Until then Safari subscribers can still read the &lt;a href='http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780133036138'&gt;rough cut&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the copy-edited text, but lacks the final layout and index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final book has 172 pages, which is sadly longer than we&amp;#8217;d hoped. We hope you&amp;#8217;ll forgive us for that.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 14 Dec 2006&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the habit of creating &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Neologism.html"&gt;Neologism&lt;/a&gt;s to describe
the things I see in software development. It's a common habit amongst
writers in this field, for software development still lacks much useful
jargon. One of the problems with building a jargon is that terms
are vulnerable to losing their meaning, in a process of
semantic diffusion - to use yet another potential addition to our
jargon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined a
	person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets
	spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that
	definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely -
	and with it any usefulness to the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm partly prompted to write this because I see this semantic
	diffusion happening very publicly to
	two terms at the moment: 'agile' and '&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Web2.0.html"&gt;Web2.0&lt;/a&gt;'. Both were coined in the
	last few years and both come with lengthy definitions. (Agile has
	the &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;agile manifesto&lt;/a&gt;,
	together with numerous books and &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; by
	the authors of the manifesto. Web 2.0 has an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html"&gt;definitional
	article&lt;/a&gt; by Tim O'Reilly.) Yet both of these face a lot of corruption
	in the field. I've run into people who think agile methods mean you
	shouldn't do any planning and those who think Web 2.0 is solely
	about using AJAX. (A more personal case is &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RefactoringMalapropism.html"&gt;RefactoringMalapropism&lt;/a&gt;,
	but I'll leave that aside for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion is essentially a succession of Chinese
whispers where a different group of people to the originators of a
term  start talking about it without being careful about following the
original definition. These people are listened to by a further group
which then goes on to add their own distortions. After a few of these
hand-offs it's easy to lose a lot of the key meaning of the term
unless you make the point of going back to the originators. It's
ironic that it's popular terms that tend to suffer from this the most.
That's inevitable, of course, since unpopular terms have less people
to create the Chinese whisper chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion tends to coincide with hype phase of an idea.
As an idea becomes attractive, lots of people are... well... attracted. Many
of these followers talk about the term and teach about it.  If these
people aren't careful to go back to the source, the Chinese whispers
begin. Popular ideas also spread primarily though communication media
that are more likely to lead to misunderstanding - such as
writing. Many followers aren't fortunate enough to work directly with
the originators and thus learn directly from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related indicator to popularity is desirability. A word that
sounds good may be more likely to suffer from semantic diffusion.
'Agile' sounds like something you'd certainly want to be, the antonyms
of agile aren't at all appealing. Who would want to still be merely
1.0 of the web? Kent Beck noticed this effect and thus deliberately
picked Extreme Programming as a name because it less inherently
desirable: 'extreme' is often used as a pejorative. Using a less
desirable term may reduce semantic diffusion, but I don't think it
avoids the problem completely. After all we saw semantic diffusion
occur to 'object-oriented' which is a neutral term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion is more likely to occur with things that are
	broad concepts rather than hard technologies. Ruby on Rails is
	getting a lot of hype at the moment, but since it's a concrete tool
	it's hard for its meaning to weaken. Extreme Programming's list of
	concrete practices may also reduce this problem compared to agile's
	broader list of values and principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantic diffusion is a painful process to watch, particularly
	for those who find the ideas useful. At the moment I see signs of despair
	for both of these terms, some people in the agile world are talking
	of ditching the word agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm more sanguine about all this, largely because I've seen it
before. There was a time when almost any software tool or method was
described as object-oriented. But now, years later, the essential
meaning of OO is reasonably well understood. I saw the same thing
happen with patterns. So terms do recover their semantic integrity and
the current diffusion doesn't inevitably mean the terms will lose
their meaning. I'm also less worried about it because I expected it,
again having gone through this process before. I think it's an
inevitable consequence of ideas becoming popular and despite its
problems, I prefer the hype to ignorance. A final comforting thought
is that once the equally inevitable backlash comes we get a refocusing
on the original meaning. As I'm writing this I'm comforted by the fact
that I can't think of a
term that lost its meaning entirely, although I'm sure it's happened.
(SOA doesn't count, as I don't think there ever was a commonly agreed
meaning for that to start with.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the eventual outcome we still have to cope with semantic
diffusion as it happens. One option is abandonment, to drop the
diffuse term and pick a new one. I don't like this option because a
new term only adds to the confusion and even if you're successful you just
end up repeating the process for the new term. So my preference is to keep
re-articulating the current terminology, pointing to those who
understand the true meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication is that these terms also shift. I'm sure
if you asked the original seventeen authors of the agile manifesto,
they would come up with a different document today. (Let alone the
fact that that group wouldn't be the best group to speak for the
movement today.) Again it's a responsibility for those who are
identified as originators to point this out, both by talking about the
way the ideas evolve and by pointing to new people who are playing an
active role in that evolution. (I'm pleased that the original
seventeen &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileStory.html"&gt;"let the ship
sail"&lt;/a&gt; to go its own way.) Let's not forget there's a tricky
balance between holding to a clear definition and dogmatism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is hard work, but a good term is worth fighting for -
particularly since the only bullets you need are words.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m extra-pleased this time, because it gives me the chance to highlight some valuable software development techniques that I feel are particularly under-used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first started using agile methods at the beginning of this century, one of our biggest questions was how to handle database design in an agile way. Fortunately we had Pramod Sadalage around, a DBA who was determined to find a way to incorporate databases with the agile working style. He developed a set of techniques, including regular database refactoring and scripted migrations that are version-controlled with application code. These techniques have now becomes habitual for ThoughtWorks but have not been as widely adopted in the industry as I believe they should. This podcast provides an hour or so that outlines how this all works, which I&amp;#8217;m hoping will encourage greater usage of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Retreaded: ServiceCustodian</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceCustodian.html"/>
    <updated>2012-05-24T09:01:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2012-05-24:Retreaded--ServiceCustodian</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 14 Nov 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine a pretty world of SOA-happiness where the computing
  needs of an enterprise are split into many small applications that
  provide services to each other to allow effective collaboration. One
  fine morning a consumer service needs some information from a supplier
  service. The twist is that although the supplier service has the
  necessary data and processing logic to get this information, it
  doesn't yet expose that information through a service interface. The
  supplier has a potential service, but it isn't actually there yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world the developers of the consumer service just asks
  the supplier service to develop the potential service and all is
  dandy. But life is not ideal - the sticking point here is that the
  developers of the supplier service have other things to do, usually
  things that are more important to their customer and management than
  helping out the consumer service team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was chatting with my colleague Erik D&#xF6;rnenburg and he
  told me about an approach he saw a client use to deal with
  this problem. They took a leaf out of the open source play-book and
  made all their services into internal open source systems. This
  allows consumer service developers write the service themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure many readers are rolling their eyes at the visions of
  chaos this would cause, but just as open source projects don't allow
  just anyone to edit anything; this client uses open-source-style control
  mechanisms. In particular each service has a couple of custodians -
  people whose responsibility it is to keep the service in a healthy
  state. In the normal course of events the consumer developer wouldn't
  actually commit changes to the supplier source tree directly,
  instead they send a patch to the custodian. Just like an open-source
  maintainer, the custodian receives the patch and reviews it to see
  if it's good enough to commit. If not there's a dialog with the
  consumer developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Erik knows well from &lt;a href="http://erik.doernenburg.com/open-source-projects/"&gt;his own open
  source work&lt;/a&gt;, reviewing a patch is much less effort than making
  a change yourself. So although the custodian approach doesn't
  entirely eliminate the problem of consumer developers needing to wait
  on supplier developers, it does a lot to reduce the difficulty. And
  again following the open-source model, a consumer developer can be
  made a committer once the custodians are comfortable. This
  still means that commits can get reviewed by the custodians, but avoids
  the custodians becoming a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this was their approach to a service registry. We've
  seen a lot of fancy products being sold to provide service registry
  capabilities so that people can lookup services and see how to use
  them. This client discarded them and used a
  &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumaneRegistry.html"&gt;HumaneRegistry&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

In this article Giles Alexander outlines two opening gambits - laser and cover-your-bases - and how to choose between and build on these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 06 Sep 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard a couple of questions recently about coming up with a
	standard story point mechanism for multiple teams using extreme
	programming's planning approach. The hope is have several teams all
	using equivalent story points, so that three story points of effort
	on one team is the same as on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think trying to come up with this at best of limited value, and
	at worst dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimating system of extreme programming is based on
		&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html"&gt;XpVelocity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/YesterdaysWeather.html"&gt;YesterdaysWeather&lt;/a&gt;. Inherent
		in this is the idea that when you make estimates, the actual units
		you estimate aren't important - what's important is you estimate
		by rough comparative value and use &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/YesterdaysWeather.html"&gt;YesterdaysWeather&lt;/a&gt;
		for calibration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation the story points act as an anchor for the
		feedback loop that Yesterday's Weather provides - nothing more.
		Baked into them are all sorts of assumptions about the nature of
		the team's task, the capability of the team, and whether the team
		are optimistic or pessimistic estimators. Once you try to come up
		with a standard across teams you are trying to normalize all of
		these factors. Trying to do this sounds very hard to me, and I'm
		not aware of anyone who has done this effectively. This doesn't
		mean its impossible, it just means it's hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dangerous aspect comes from once you have a standard unit for
	measurement across teams, someone is inevitably going to use it to
	compare the performance of teams. Even if everyone swears till they
	are blue in the face that they won't use it for cross team
	measurement, there will always be the suspicion that this will
	happen eventually. This will cause teams to distort their
	measurements so that it seems that they get more story points
	done. My fear is that this will break the feedback loop of
	yesterday's weather and knock the planning process off kilter. I'm
	always suspicious about these things because while it would be
	incredibly valuable to have a way to measure productivity I think
		the nature of software is such that we &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html"&gt;CannotMeasureProductivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to be worth trying, this has to yield some valuable benefits -
	but I don't see any. One reason that I've heard is to help people
	move onto teams and estimate more quickly. But you can't estimate on
	a new team until you get reasonably familiar with the problem and
	the current code base. As you do that you'll also get a feel for the
	relative sizes of story points on that team. We move people around
	between projects at ThoughtWorks and I've never heard anyone
	complain about difficulty of estimating when coming onto a new team
	due to differences in story points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Published Interface&lt;/i&gt; is a term I used (first in &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html"&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;)
to refer to a class interface that's used outside the code base that
it's defined in. As such it means more than public in Java and indeed
even more than a non-internal public in C#. In my column for IEEE
Software I argued
that &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/published.pdf"&gt;the distinction between published and public is actually more
important than that between public and private.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that with a non-published interface you can change
it and update the calling code since it is all within a single code
base. Such things as renames can be done, and done easily with modern
refactoring tools. But anything published so you can't reach the
calling code needs more complicated treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 28 Jul 2006&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone is looking at what makes up a top-class enterprise
	software developer, often the conversation may turn to knowledge of
	frameworks and languages, or perhaps the ability to understand
	complicated algorithms and data structures. For me, one of the most
	important traits in a programmer, or indeed in a development team,
	is something that I'll call Customer Affinity. This is the interest
	and closeness that the developers have in the business problem that
	the software is addressing, and in the people who live in that
	business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many aspects to customer affinity. The first one is
	just the interest in the business, its processes and rules. I've
	always been fascinated by domains I've worked in: health care,
	derivatives, payroll, leasing - are all examples of really
	interesting domain problems with a lot of complexity that has to be
	organized and understood. For me aspects of a project such as
	object-relational mapping, remote process communication - what I
	think of as the plumbing of enterprise systems, don't have that same
	interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important that a team has the plumbing working and under
control, but I believe that the more energy goes into the business
problem, the more effective at providing value a team will be. Which
is a good reason to use frameworks that solve and simplify as much of
the plumbing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of customer affinity is the ability to
	collaborate with domain experts. I don't think that detailed
	knowledge of the domain is an important thing for programmers to
	have; useful yes, but not important. What's more critical than
	knowledge is the ability to collaborate with those that have the
	knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My high regard for customer affinity is one the main reasons why
	I'm such a fan of Extreme Programming and other agile methods. I
	found it very significant that when Kent Beck summarized XP to his
	agile peers at the snowbird workshop which coined 'agile', he chose
	to describe not the technical elements of XP, but his desire to
	change the nature of the customer/developer interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've often heard this relationship mis-characterized. In
particular there is a belief in some quarters that the customer team
just comes up with stories which they throw at the developers. This
characterization is rather like the notion that requirements are just
lying out there to be gathered. Either way that's
not much of a collaboration. Instead developers need to work together
with domain people to
generate ideas with developers learning a lot about the business in
the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Kent's suggested names for 'Agile' was
&lt;i&gt;conversational&lt;/i&gt; software development - the point being that it's
a two way communication. This isn't something like a telecoms protocol
that you can define, but the back and forth discussions about how
software can enhance the business are where the real value
lives. Much of this conversation is of half-baked ideas, some of which
grow into valuable features - often ones that aren't things that the
customer originally thought of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that frustrates me is how organizations often
	try to squelch customer affinity. It's not something people admit to
	doing, but it's a common consequence of other
	decisions. Organizational barriers can contribute to squelching -
	I've come across places where
	you have to get your manager to arrange with another manager just so
	you can have a conversation with someone on the business side. That
	hardly encourages you to get inside the workings of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've often heard it said that enterprise software is boring, just
	shuffling data around, that people of talent will do "real" software
	that requires fancy algorithms, hardware hacks, or plenty of
	math. I feel that this usually  happens
	due to a lack of customer affinity. The real intellectual challenge
	of business software is figuring out what the real
	contribution of software can be to a business. You need both good
	technical and business knowledge to find that.  Working closely with
	business people to develop this knowledge, and
	&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PleasingTheCustomer.html"&gt;PleasingTheCustomer&lt;/a&gt; as you do it, is  what makes
	enterprise software development fun - and motivation is the key to good
	and productive work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of bright and capable people who want to learn
	about the businesses they write software for. Too often
	organizations make it hard for them to do so. Until that changes,
	our profession will continue to under-deliver on our potential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time for a progress report on &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/bliki/NosqlDistilled.html'&gt;NoSQL Distilled&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve done a round of technical review and are now pretty happy with the text, happy enough to move it into production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production for a book these days is both more complicated and more responsive than it used to be. The next step on the book text is to do copy-editing and indexing. It sounds like we are going to get the &lt;a href='http://www.kirsanov.com/'&gt;same people&lt;/a&gt; I worked with on &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html'&gt;my DSL book&lt;/a&gt;, which will be excellent news since they did a good job and were happy to work directly on the XML source in my repository. This simplifies and speeds up the whole process. They will also do the book design and convert the book in camera-ready for printing the physical books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect, however, that this book will see more electronic copies than physical ones. In parallel with the copy-editing we&amp;#8217;ll be preparing the electronic copies. We intend to do a rough-cut version of the book as soon as we can. This should be available through &lt;a href='http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=8877bf0c-92bd-4d0d-8317-d67fe8b88eee'&gt;InformIT&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon, and &lt;a href='http://my.safaribooksonline.com'&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Retreaded: SpecificationByExample</title>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 18 Mar 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was attending a workshop at XP/Agile Universe in 2002 when the
phrase 'Specification By Example' struck me as a way to describe one
of roles of testing in &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html#xp"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(These days it's terribly unfashionable to talk about Test Driven
Development (TDD) having anything to do with testing, but like &lt;a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/tirsen/archives/000582_tdd_is_about_testing.html"&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt; I do think that having a comprehensive automated test suite
is more valuable than the term 'side-effect' implies. Rather like if
someone offered me a million dollars to hike up a mountain. I may say
that the main purpose of the hike is the enjoyment of nature, but the
side-effect to my wallet is hardly trivial....)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specification By Example isn't the way most of us have been
brought up to think of specifications. Specifications are supposed to
be general, to cover all cases. Examples only highlight a few points,
you have to infer the generalizations yourself. This does mean that
Specification By Example can't be the only requirements technique you
use, but it doesn't mean that it can't take a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the dominant idea with rigorous specifications, that is
those that can be clearly judged to be passed or failed, is to use pre
and post conditions. These techniques dominate in formal methods, and
also underpin &lt;a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/contract/"&gt;Design

by Contract&lt;/a&gt;. These techniques have their place, but they aren't
ideal. The pre-post conditions can be very easy to write in some
situations, but others can be very tricky. I've tried to use them in a
number enterprise application settings, and I've found that in many
situations it's as hard to write the pre and post conditions as it is
to write the solution. One of the great things about specification by
example is that examples are usually much easier to come up with,
particularly for the non-nerds who we write the software for. (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201824191?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0201824191"&gt;Timothy Budd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt; pointed out that while you can
show a lot of stack behavior with pre and post conditions, it's very
tricky to write pre and post conditions that show the LIFO
property.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important property of TDD tests is that they involve a
double-check. In fact this highlights an amusing little lie of the XP
community. They make a very strong point of saying things Once and
Only Once, but in fact they always say things twice: once in the code
and once in the tests. Kent has pointed out that this double-check
principle is a vital principle, and it's certainly one that humans use
all the time. The value of the double check is very much tied into
using different methods for each side of the double check. Combining
Specification By Example with production code means that you have both
things said quite differently, which increases their ability to find
errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal specification community have constantly had trouble
verifying that a design satisfies a specification, particularly in
doing this without error prone humans. For Specification By Example,
this is easy. Another case of Specification By Example being less
valuable in theory but more valuable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Design by Contract fan pointed out that if you write a
specification in terms of tests, then the supplier could satisfy the
specification by just returning hard-coded responses to the specific
test inputs. My flippant answer to this is that if you are concerned
about this then the issue of tests versus Design by Contract is the
least of your worries. But there is a serious point here. Tests are
always going to be incomplete, so they always have to be backed up
with other mechanisms. Being the twisted mind that I am, I actually
see this as a plus. Since it's clear that Specification By Example
isn't enough, it's clear that you need to do more to ensure that
everything is properly communicated. One of the most dangerous things
about a traditional requirements specification is when people think
that once they've written it they are done communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specification By Example only works in the context of a working
relationship where both sides are collaborating and not fighting. The
examples trigger abstractions in the design team while keeping the
abstractions grounded. You do need more - things like regular
conversation, techniques like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321125215"&gt;Domain Driven
Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt;, indeed even doses of Design by Contract. While I've
never had the opportunity to use Design by Contract fully (i.e. with
Eiffel) I regularly think about interfaces in contractual terms.
Specification By Example is a powerful tool, perhaps my most used
tool, but never my only tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For more thinking on Specification By Example, if not by that
name, take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/"&gt;Brian Marick's&lt;/a&gt;
writings. Somewhere on his site there probably is one super page that
sums up his view on it. Of course finding it is less valuable than
reading all the stuff there while you're trying) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years after I first wrote this, there was a &lt;a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000392.html"&gt;post by Cedric
	Beust&lt;/a&gt; that was critical of agile methods that
	caused a minor blog spat. There were rebuttals by &lt;a href="http://www.langrsoft.com/blog/2006/06/open-note-to-google-i-thank-google-one.html"&gt;Jeff Langr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.AgilePeopleStillDontGetIt"&gt;Bob
	Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and I sent this post through the feed again.  Jeff Langr
  later added a &lt;a href="http://www.langrsoft.com/blog/2006/06/are-tests-specs-ive-presented-tdd.html"&gt;nice
	example&lt;/a&gt; using using tests as specification by example for Java's
	Math.pow function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 07 Dec 2005&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my writing endeavors, I've long intended to write a chunk of
	material on validation. It's an area that leads to a lot of
	confusion and it would be good to get some solid description of some
	of the techniques that work well. However life is full of things to
	write about, rather more than time allows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some recent readings made me think about saying a few
	preliminary things on the topic. One common thing I see people do
	is to develop validation routines for objects. These routines come
	in various ways, they may be in the object or external, they may
	return a boolean or throw an exception to indicate failure. But one
	thing that I think constantly trips people up is when they think
	object validity on a context independent way such as an &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt;
	method implies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's much more useful to think of validation as something
that's bound to a context - typically an action that you want to do.
Is this order valid to be filled, is this customer valid to check in
to the hotel. So rather than have methods like &lt;code&gt;isValid&lt;/code&gt;
have methods like &lt;code&gt;isValidForCheckIn&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the consequences of this is that saving an object to a
	database is itself an action. Thinking about it that way raises some
	important questions. Often when people talk about a context-free
	validity, they mean it in terms of saving to a database. But the
	various validity checks that make this up should be interrogated
	with the question "should failing this test prevent saving?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568843224?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1568843224"&gt;About Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="width: 1px !important; height: 1px !important; border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/&gt; Alan Cooper advocated that we shouldn't let
our ideas of valid states prevent a user from entering (and saving)
incomplete information. I was reminded by this a few days ago when
reading a draft of a book that &lt;a href="http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/rss.xml"&gt;Jimmy Nilsson&lt;/a&gt; is working
on. He stated a principle that you should always be able to save an
object, even if it has errors in it. While I'm not convinced that this
should be an absolute rule, I do think people tend to prevent saving
more than they ought. Thinking about the context for validation may
help prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class = 'original'&gt;&lt;a href = 'http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Retread.html'&gt;Retread&lt;/a&gt; of post orginally made on 08 Mar 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many debates in software development are underpinned by whether
the speaker has a &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DirectingAttitude.html"&gt;DirectingAttitude&lt;/a&gt; or an
&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EnablingAttitude.html"&gt;EnablingAttitude&lt;/a&gt;. These different attitudes affect choices
over languages, designs, tools, processes, and lots more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some examples of this dichotomy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A debate a while ago triggered by Joel Spolsky's post on &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/13.html"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;.

He didn't like exceptions because they could be misused badly, leading
to confusing code (directing). Bill Caputo &lt;a href="http://www.williamcaputo.com/archives/000009.html"&gt;pointed
out&lt;/a&gt; that exceptions, when used well, make life much easier
(enabling).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Some of the static/dynamic typing debate brings up these
points. Some arguments in favor of static typing talk about how they
prevent people from making certain kinds of mistake (directing) while
dynamic typers point out how static typing restricts some useful
idioms (enabling).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Agile processes are &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PeopleOriented.html"&gt;PeopleOriented&lt;/a&gt; (enabling),
while plan-driven methods seek to ensure that even a poor team can do
an acceptable job (directing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren't hard-wired attitudes. Often people are directing in
some cases and enabling in others. But I think there is a deep strain
running through here, often a personality issue, that runs underneath
much discussion on how we do software. (I'm very much in the enabling
category, as if you can't tell.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that all restrictions on what a developer does
imply a directing attitude, but it's not that simple. As an example,
consider memory management. You can think of this as a directing
feature: programmers can't be trusted to manage memory correctly so
take away their ability to allocate memory. But I look at memory
management as an enabling technology - it takes away something I don't
&lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to worry about, so I can concentrate better on those
things I do care about. Steve &lt;a href="http://stevef.truemesh.com/archives/000206.html"&gt;tied this thought nicely&lt;/a&gt; onto the
difference between problems and difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

Done well they allow frequent communication across the team with a high signal to noise ratio. Done badly, they can be pretty grim. For several years, this article by Jason Yip has become the definitive source of information on how to make them better. Jason has just finished a comprehensive revision of the article, so if you&amp;#8217;re looking to get the best from your stand-ups, you should take a good look at the tips in here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This is an excellent conference with a good range of material across both technology and process. This year I&amp;#8217;ll be participating in a pair of tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 9 I&amp;#8217;ll be with Jez Humble doing our full-day tutorial on Continuous Delivery, the first time we&amp;#8217;ve brought this tutorial to Aarhus. This will cover much of the ground in Jez and Dave&amp;#8217;s award winning book including the business case for Continuous Delivery, deployment pipelines, testing strategies, version control organization, and recipes for going live. We&amp;#8217;ve had a lot of good feedback on this tutorial so far, so I&amp;#8217;m glad to finally bring this to my favorite conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Oct 13 I&amp;#8217;ll join Rebecca Parsons to talk about Evolutionary Architecture. Rebecca&amp;#8217;s long been our chief technical firefighter on difficult projects, which often have complicated dependencies to enterprise architecture. I&amp;#8217;ve long been urging her to talk more about her experiences and techniques for handling these issues, so it will be good to work with her on this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between I&amp;#8217;ll be hanging around the conference catching up on all the good pickings that will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you want to register, using the discount code &amp;#8220;fowl1250&amp;#8221; will get you a worthwhile discount.)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In 2009-10 he wrote a &lt;a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-eaed1/index.html'&gt;series of fifteen articles&lt;/a&gt; for IBM developerWorks which dug deeper into the question of evolutionary architecture and design. His topics included Test Driven Development, leveraging reusable code, refactoring towards design and Domain-Specific Languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he&amp;#8217;s followed on from this and recorded a &lt;a href='http://my.safaribooksonline.com/video/-/9781449314439'&gt;video workshop on Agile Engineering Practices&lt;/a&gt; for O&amp;#8217;Reilly that&amp;#8217;s available on safari books online. These cover much of the topics that make evolutionary design possible, including Test-Driven Design, automation, and testing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the software world, we have the &lt;a href='http://drdobbs.com/joltawards'&gt;Jolt awards&lt;/a&gt;. These were originally run by Software Development magazine and are now run by Dr Dobbs magazine. My books have won a couple of &amp;#8216;productivity awards&amp;#8217; - which are essentially the runner-up awards - but I&amp;#8217;ve never snagged to top award (now called the &amp;#8216;excellence award&amp;#8217;). This year my &lt;a href='\'&gt;DSL book&lt;/a&gt; was up for an award and &lt;a href='http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=2'&gt;won a &amp;#8216;finalist award&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; (essentially this means I was runner-up to the runner-ups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I failed again, but this year I would have been very annoyed if I had won. I&amp;#8217;ve argued all year that Jez and Dave&amp;#8217;s book on &lt;a href='http://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html'&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt; was the most important book released this year, and so I&amp;#8217;m glad that Dr Dobbs &lt;a href='http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=7'&gt;agreed with me&lt;/a&gt; and gave them the excellence award. Congratulations to Jez and Dave in joining the long list of people who have kept me away from this award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I keep missing the top prize, my signature series has a very good record with these awards. The 10 books in my series so far have picked up 1 finalist, 4 productivity and 2 excellence awards. Not a bad hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This is where a bunch of my colleagues get together and discuss the technologies that they think are worth keeping an eye on. It&amp;#8217;s not intended to be some comprehensively researched list, as it&amp;#8217;s just the aggregation of the opinions of the small group of people that create it. But since that group is an experienced group of ThoughtWorks consultants, I think it&amp;#8217;s a useful pointer to things to pay attention to in enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

It does this by running all its business logic on a single JVM thread, getting high speed without all the complications of concurrent programming.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my long flight down to Australia recently I dug into a copy of &lt;a href='http://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks'&gt;Seven Languages in Seven Weeks&lt;/a&gt;. I spent less than seven hours on it, but found it a worthwhile read. He takes a lightening tour through seven languages. It&amp;#8217;s not enough to go into much depth on any them, but it is enough to get a rough feel what&amp;#8217;s interesting about them. I&amp;#8217;d particularly recommend it if you are just starting to explore beyond the curly-brace languages that dominate so much of current programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I particularly appreciate about pragprog books is that you get access to electronic versions in multiple formats. This book worked very well on the Kindle, despite the small screen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In conversations with project teams, I&amp;#8217;ve heard a lot about problems with flaky, unreliable tests. These non-deterministic tests are a serious problem with testing efforts. So I&amp;#8217;ve written an article that talks about how to deal with these non-determinisms, discussing how to cope with some common causes: lack of isolation, asynchronous behavior, remote services, time, and resource leaks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve posted &lt;a href='../articles/malware.html'&gt;an article detailing our malware attack&lt;/a&gt;. The short form is that we believe our sites are clear, but we currently have to operate them with reduced functionality. The malware only attacks a small proportion of visitors (which is part of what makes it difficult to deal with). However if you have visited our sites since Christmas with a windows machine, you should read more.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Investigating ThoughtWorks in Vancouver</title>

He&amp;#8217;s been one of the first to help start our offices in England, China, and Brazil. Last week I got an email saying he&amp;#8217;s investigating possibilities in Vancouver. He&amp;#8217;s looking for people to talk to: so if you&amp;#8217;re a prospective client, possible employee, or are just friendly and looking to have Sid buy you a free food - get in touch with him by &lt;a href='mailto:sgpinney@thoughtworks.com'&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/twsidpinney'&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Malware alert on thoughtworks.com</title>
    <link href="http://martinfowler.com/snips/201102031214.html"/>
    <updated>2011-02-03T12:14:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>tag:martinfowler.com,2011-02-03:Malware-alert-on-thoughtworks-com</id>
    <category term=""/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We seem to have a shy but annoying piece of malware hanging out on thoughtworks.com. As far as we can tell, it manifests itself as a hidden iframe that redirects you to a site that hosts malware. We&amp;#8217;re a bit vague on this, as it only appears rarely so only a couple of people have seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest sign of it is via google. Google reported our site on Jan 7th as having problems, we looked into it, didn&amp;#8217;t find anything, and Google&amp;#8217;s complaint went away very quickly. The flag went up again on Jan 31st and this time they emailed our webmaster. We looked again for a problem, without any success, so we asked them to re-review our site. Since then various Google diagnostics have raising and lowering the suspicious flag at a dizzying rate. As I write this the site is considered safe, but given the volatility of the opinion, we aren&amp;#8217;t sure about how things will go. (If you&amp;#8217;re concerned you can check &lt;a href='http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=www.thoughtworks.com'&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s safebrowsing link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is a bit of malware that&amp;#8217;s set to only show itself occasionally, which makes it harder to deal with. The tricky bit is to find how it&amp;#8217;s getting into the site. We&amp;#8217;ve checked all our content and not found anything suspicious, but it could be third party javascript libraries, could be our Drupal instance, could even be a problem with our apache installation - but we don&amp;#8217;t know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re investigating this further (including following the recommendations of &lt;a href='http://www.stopbadware.org/home/security'&gt;stopbadware&lt;/a&gt;) but haven&amp;#8217;t yet found the root cause, although we do have some strong suspects. If you see anything suspicious on our site or would like to pass on any suggestions, please contact &lt;a href='mailto:webmaster@thoughtworks.com'&gt;Andy Yates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, this problem &lt;a href='http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=martinfowler.com'&gt;does not affect&lt;/a&gt; martinfowler.com - which is a static site built with my custom scripts, so is less likely to attract such a problem. But do let me know if you see anything.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the Churchill Club panel discussion on wikileaks on Wednesday. It&amp;#8217;s thoughtful and well worth watching &lt;a href='http://fora.tv/2011/01/19/WikiLeaks_Why_It_Matters_Why_It_Doesnt'&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly appreciated Daniel Ellsberg&amp;#8217;s picture of the climate of government secrecy and Roy&amp;#8217;s call to follow the example of librarians resisting secret gag orders. (There was a bit were it threatens to sink deep into the nature of libertarianism, but fortunately that didn&amp;#8217;t last long.) While my thoughts on wikileaks are complicated (and I&amp;#8217;ve not had the energy to write about them) I think the incident raises some very serious issues around the contending forces of privacy and openness. This panel provides a useful briefing on some of these perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
